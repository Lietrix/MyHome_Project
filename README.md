# MyHome
### By Joshua Harnett

I am a software developing student I have been studying C#, SQL, and ASP.NET for a 4 months now in a classroom
  environment, and I have been studying basic programming for around 2 years. The project I am working on is a 
  program called MyHome, it’s goal is to make data storage in a household environment effective and easy. I have
  further ambitions once I further my knowledge to bring dynamic interaction for the users to further make household 
  design more sleek and elegant. 
  
Users will first access a webpage in which they will be prompted to, Log-in, or Create New User. The homepage will display
  a menu, and have all the information regarding their house’s rooms and items. Each room will act be on the frontpage,
  while items will be listed by name, but no other information. For items to be fully seen, the user must click on the
  room and be redirected to another page. 
  
The homepage menu will include existing rooms, add rooms, settings, and logout. The settings page will include another
  menu. The user may, change the color or item schema described later, and change password. The add rooms page will show
  a list of options, like name of room, location, and each type of room will have a default layout page. When the 
  new room is created, another page will be generated for that user to be able to access. That page will display all items
  in the room, and the total room value. 
	Lastly, the logout button will simply log the user out.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

My current tables are for the first initial product for my project. In the future I will be adding how values for houses, 
  and making settings for each user, along with product advirtisements.


## Flowchart for creating a room

Users can create rooms with ease, and add items directly to these rooms. Each item will be uniquely stored within a room.
